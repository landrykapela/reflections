What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository with git init, it creates a .git folder which contains the metadata about the files history. It actually doesn't create any commits though.
	It is important to initialize the repository so that the .git directory is created and you can be allowed to add files to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an intermediary stage holding files added to the repository that are not yet committed. It gives the power to control what goes to the repository from a working directory and eventually a flexibility to reverse a mistaken addition.
